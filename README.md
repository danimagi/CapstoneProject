- actual_amount_paid: in New Taiwan Dollar (NTD)
- is_auto_renew
- transaction_date: format %Y%m%d
- membership_expire_date: format %Y%m%d
- is_cancel: whether or not the user canceled the membership in this transaction.

- num_985: # of songs played between 75% to 98.5% of the song length
- num_100: # of songs played over 98.5% of the song length
- num_unq: # of unique songs played
- total_secs: total seconds played

**members_v3.csv**
User information. Note that not every user in the dataset is available.
